<h3><span class="math inline">\(\chi^\color{red}2\)</span> SIS Analytics</h3>
<p>Your institution’s student information system (SIS) is an invaluable source of information for performing Learning Analytics and Educational Data-Mining. Beyond just students’ grades it can provide deep insight into your student population and inform other LA-systems in place. Our SIS analytics extracts this information both for use by our other systems, and for direct use by the institution as it provides interfaces for descriptive and inferential analysis, as well as precitive modeling capabilities.</p>

<p>Your SIS is a treasure trove of information waiting to be unlocked</p>

<h3>Analytics for face-to-face and hybrid courses</h3>
<p>For courses that are taught in the traditional face-to-face manner it can sometimes be trickly to collect enough data for a proper analysis. <span class="math inline">\(\chi^\color{red}2\)</span>â€™s <em>Classroom Analytics</em> bridges the gap between online and face-to-face, and provides an important suplement to hybrid courses.</p>

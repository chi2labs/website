<p>A production level learning analytics systems typically involves a lot of moving pieces. Different data-sources, systems and people need to talk to each-other in a seamless fashion in order to provide the right information to the right stakeholders in time for action to be taken. It is also the case that once a Learning Analytics system has been implemented it too becomes a non-trivial component of the organization and influences its processes and outcomes. For this reason it is important to include procedures for continuous back-testing and adjustment. Our implementation services accompanies you every step of the way.</p>

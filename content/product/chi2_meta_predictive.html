<h3><span class="math inline">\(\chi^\color{red}2\)</span> Meta-predictive Risk Model</h3>
<p>Our Meta-predictive Risk Assessment methodology allows institutions to assess the likelihood of success when implementing early warning systems. Before investing resources into a full-fledged implementation, we can assess what is likely to work and, more importantly, what will likely <em>not</em> work, this allowing the institution to target its investments in analytics to systems that will actually provide a return.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is there a <em>there</em> there, is a question that should be asked as early as possible. It avoids unsuccessful deployments of risk models, and uncovers improvement potential in institutional processes.</p>

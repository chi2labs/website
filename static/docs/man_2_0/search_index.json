["my-courses.html", "2.1 My Courses", " 2.1 My Courses The My Courses section shows an overview of the instructor’s courses on the system. It makes a distinction between Active Courses, i.e. courses that are currently running, or have start-dates in the future, and inactive courses which are past courses, or meta-courses not actually in use, or being accessed by students. 2.1.1 Information Boxes Across the top of the My Courses page there are three information boxes which lay out: The number of Active courses: Courses that are currently being accessed by students or have start-dates in the future. The number of Total courses: Courses that the instructor have access to, whether they are in active use, or no longer being used. The number of Courses that need attention: Courses where there are at least one alert or notification generated by \\(\\chi^\\color{red}2\\). 2.1.2 Latest activity This visualization shows the latest activity –typically for the last couple of weeks– for the active courses. The x-axis represents time, and the y-axis the total dwell time in each course. Each line represents one course. 2.1.3 Risk profile If a risk profile is installed and active for the course(s), the risk profiles for each course is shown. This is a density plot. 2.1.4 Courses In the courses section of the instructor dashboard lists the courses the instructor has access to. By clicking on a row in this table, the instructor can access the Course Dashboard for detailed information and analyses regarding this course. Course list example. "],

Research has shown that this interpretation is frequenty not warranted. Dwell time, sometimes dubbed time-on-task, is often weakly or even negatively correlated with academic achievement, and linear relationships found tend to show a weak effect-size. We therefore urge caution when interpreting dwell time data without any additional context. "],

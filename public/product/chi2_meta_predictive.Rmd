### $\chi^\color{red}2$ Meta-predictive Risk Model

Our Meta-predictive Risk Assessment methodology allows institutions to assess the likelihood of success when implementing early warning systems. Before investing resources into a full-fledged implementation, we can assess what is likely to work and, more importantly, what will likely *not* work, this allowing the institution to target its investments in analytics to systems that will actually provide a return. 

> Is there a *there* there, is a question that should be asked as early as possible. It avoids unsuccessful deployments of risk models, and uncovers improvement potential in institutional processes.

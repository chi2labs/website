```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Test post

This is a test post, based on a default markdown document in Rstudio. This post has been written to test out some of the features we're looking to use. For example, I would like to see how a knitr::kable would look in this template.


```{r cars}
summary(cars) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

## Trying another table

```{r}
data.frame(a=1:10,b=10:1) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
